# TILING FOR MOST DE IN LINUX

## TILING FOR KDE
I will be using kde-bismuth which can be installed from the aur using any of the aur helpers of arch linux such as **paru** or **yay** then issue the following command to get it installed.

```paru -Sy kwin-bismuth```

## TILING FOR GNOME 
```paru -Sy gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell-bin```

## Configs
---
You will find my config file attached (which is must) avoid having to reconfigure the tiling configuration everytime I reinstall (KDE).
